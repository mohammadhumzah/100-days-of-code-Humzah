**Today's Progress**: studied lecture on conditionals in python and overall programming

**Thoughts:** while studying conditionals came to know that i need revision of how to define a variable and also difference between print and return.


### Day 2: March 15,


**Today's Progress**: Learnt more about conditionals and their syntax and how to use them.

**Thoughts**: i need to invest more time on this, ideally 3-4 hours a day only then i will be able to make significant progress as i am at complete noob level. but hey atleast i did something



### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
