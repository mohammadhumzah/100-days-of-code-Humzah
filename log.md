# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 14, 2025


**Today's Progress**: studied lecture on conditionals in python and overall programming

**Thoughts:** while studying conditionals came to know that i need revision of how to define a variable and also difference between print and return.


### Day 2: March 15, 2025


**Today's Progress**: Learnt more about conditionals and their syntax and how to use them.

**Thoughts**: i need to invest more time on this, ideally 3-4 hours a day only then i will be able to make significant progress as i am at complete noob level. but hey atleast i did something



### Day 3: March 16, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Went through another short on boolean expressions and how to use AND OR NOT  and how to combine them together to write better code. even coded a better version of game recommender.

**Thoughts** Still making mistakes on syntax need to be more mindful of that and above all need to study for longer period of time. i need to find time.

### Day 5: March 18, Tuesday

Didnt code yesterday due to a function.

**Today's Progress**: Solved a problem of psrt one based on conditionals. need to revise stuff more

**Thoughts**: NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME else this just sounds like a hobby.

### Day 6: March 19, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 problems, in the first and second learnt about more string methods like startswith() & endswith(). i didn't know about these string methods so i had to take help from internet.

**Thoughts**: I think i should utilise the duck from CS50 to give me hints. the good part was that i spent more time today and learnt something too. will need to revise small little things, most of the problems i am facing is due to lack of not knowing syntax, will try and tackle this problem by revising and reading more.


### Day 7: March 21, Thrusday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a problem based on meal timings. Had to use conditionals and also there was a need to define own function. Also revised some previous stuff to brush up my syntax. The meal timing problem could have been done all by myself if i continued first writing solution on paper, need to understand each part of question before going to solve it.

**Thoughts**: Whilst revising i realised the problems up until now have been easy, or do they seem easy to me now. I can figure out what to do most of the time but i need to learn how to convert it into proper code.
