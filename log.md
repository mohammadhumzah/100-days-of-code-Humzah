# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 14, 2025


**Today's Progress**: studied lecture on conditionals in python and overall programming

**Thoughts:** while studying conditionals came to know that i need revision of how to define a variable and also difference between print and return.


### Day 2: March 15, 2025


**Today's Progress**: Learnt more about conditionals and their syntax and how to use them.

**Thoughts**: i need to invest more time on this, ideally 3-4 hours a day only then i will be able to make significant progress as i am at complete noob level. but hey atleast i did something



### Day 3: March 16, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Went through another short on boolean expressions and how to use AND OR NOT  and how to combine them together to write better code. even coded a better version of game recommender.

**Thoughts** Still making mistakes on syntax need to be more mindful of that and above all need to study for longer period of time. i need to find time.

### Day 5: March 18, Tuesday

Didnt code yesterday due to a function.

**Today's Progress**: Solved a problem of psrt one based on conditionals. need to revise stuff more

**Thoughts**: NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME else this just sounds like a hobby.
