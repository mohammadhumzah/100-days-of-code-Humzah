# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 14, 2025


**Today's Progress**: studied lecture on conditionals in python and overall programming

**Thoughts:** while studying conditionals came to know that i need revision of how to define a variable and also difference between print and return.


### Day 2: March 15, 2025


**Today's Progress**: Learnt more about conditionals and their syntax and how to use them.

**Thoughts**: i need to invest more time on this, ideally 3-4 hours a day only then i will be able to make significant progress as i am at complete noob level. but hey atleast i did something



### Day 3: March 16, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Went through another short on boolean expressions and how to use AND OR NOT  and how to combine them together to write better code. even coded a better version of game recommender.

**Thoughts** Still making mistakes on syntax need to be more mindful of that and above all need to study for longer period of time. i need to find time.

### Day 5: March 18, Tuesday

Didnt code yesterday due to a function.

**Today's Progress**: Solved a problem of psrt one based on conditionals. need to revise stuff more

**Thoughts**: NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME else this just sounds like a hobby.

### Day 6: March 19, Wednesday 

**Today's Progress**: Solved 3 problems, in the first and second learnt about more string methods like startswith() & endswith(). i didn't know about these string methods so i had to take help from internet.

**Thoughts**: I think i should utilise the duck from CS50 to give me hints. the good part was that i spent more time today and learnt something too. will need to revise small little things, most of the problems i am facing is due to lack of not knowing syntax, will try and tackle this problem by revising and reading more.


### Day 7: March 21, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved a problem based on meal timings. Had to use conditionals and also there was a need to define own function. Also revised some previous stuff to brush up my syntax. The meal timing problem could have been done all by myself if i continued first writing solution on paper, need to understand each part of question before going to solve it.

**Thoughts**: Whilst revising i realised the problems up until now have been easy, or do they seem easy to me now. I can figure out what to do most of the time but i need to learn how to convert it into proper code. 


### Day 8: March 22, Saturday

**Todays Progress**: Started lecture on loops. Learnt about For and While loop. 
I need to get in on this now. Make it a priority 

**Thoughts**: Pythonic code makes it easy to code i need learn more ways how to do it. like today i learnt about range function which allows to go upto infinite number of values repeatedly by one click. Also learnt if some variable is not important designate it with _ 

Another one was the print("meow"*3). Through this also revised about parameters of print function


### Day 9: March 23, Sunday

**Todays Progress**: Completed lecture on loops and learnt use of dictionaries and Lists and list of dictionaries.

**Thoughts**: Course is actually starting now so i need to devote more time.

### Day 10: March 24, Monday

**Todays Progress**: Completed a short based on dictionaries and dictionary methods like keys,value,pop,get.

**Thoughts**:Not enough time i studied so no thoughts

### Day 11: March 25, Tuesday

**Todays Progress**: Learnt about dictionary and list methods. Also learnt about tuples and when to use them and string slicing and how to do it.

**Thoughts**: I need to practice the syntax of everything i have learnt before solving the pset. Lots of pythonic code to understand and only by writing code myself will i understand it better. That will be better than making notes

### Day 12: March 26, Wednesday 

**Todays Progress**:Wrote syntax of previously mentioned dictionary and list methods like get("":"","":"") keys(). 

**Thoughts**:Need to get better at pythonic code writing, combining functions loops conditionals. Making full use of python

### Day 13: March 28, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved 4 Pset problems. Camel.py, twttr.py, coke.py, plates.py. Combined string methods with conditionals. Also learnt string slicing s[i:] which slices string from ith index till end

**Thoughts**: Learnt about concatenation of strings without overwriting them using string+=. Used Lists, also used new string methods like isupper() which lets us know whether a letter is upper case,isalnum() which lets us know if our input has alphabets and numbers only. Also made use of isdigit() whether it is a digit or not.

### Day 14: March 29, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about exceptions and debugging and how to predict exceptions and handle them before hand.

**Thoughts**: For 2 consecutive days i programmed for couple of hours without knowing. Need to write more code myself in order to become efficient and better

### Day 15: March 30, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Solved problem based on exceptions. Learnt about "continue" statement when i want to repeat some action previously taken. 

### Day 16: April 3, Thrusday

**Today's Progress**: Solved 2 problems based on loops and conditionals and use of exceptions.

### Day 17: April 4, Friday
 
**Today's Progress**: Completed pset 3. The problem today was bit complicated with use of multiple concepts.

### Day 18 & 19: April 23 and April 24

**Today's Progress**: Started the course again after 2 week break due to mid sems. Learnt from week 4 lecture related to libraries, different sort of libraries such as sys. Also Learnt about API calling and JSON Format.

**Thoughts**: Need to ramp up to cover up for the time lost. Will write more code myself, to implement above concepts and get familiar with their syntax such as when to use get function and when no need. Waking earlier to do this is the only way.

### Day 20 and 21: Friday

**Today's Progress**: Solved problem set based on libraries, except one problem involving API calls. Will do that tomorrow.

### Day 22: April 26, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Completed problem based on api calling for bitcoin price. Also learnt about unit tests and use of pytest.

**Thoughts**: Getting a bit better at it, need to hasten up and complete pset tomorrow along with another lecture.

### Day 23: April 27, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Did 2 problems based on writing unit tests. Need to write more psuedo code.

**Thoughts**: Should have done more, will complete 2 lectures this week.

### Day 24: April 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed problemset on unit tests and now i know how and what sort of tests to write.

**Thoughts**: Will complete next lecture tomorrow.
